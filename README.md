_Founder:_ Mark Newman  

_Origin of the Idea:_

### Business Activities
**Problem Addressed:** HireVue aims to enhance the recruitment process by addressing inefficiencies and biases inherent in traditional hiring methods.

**Intended Customers and Market Size:** HireVue primarily serves organizations seeking to improve their hiring processes, including large enterprises, mid-sized companies, and recruitment agencies. While specific market size data isn't provided, the global recruitment software market was valued at approximately $2.3 billion in 2020 and is projected to grow [15], indicating a substantial and expanding customer base for HireVue's solutions.

**Unique Value Proposition:** HireVue differentiates itself through its AI-driven video interviewing and assessment platform. By analyzing candidates' verbal and non-verbal cues, HireVue provides insights into competencies like communication and problem-solving skills, offering a more holistic evaluation than traditional methods. This approach not only streamlines the hiring process but also aims to reduce biases, promoting a more equitable selection process. [16]

**Technologies Utilized:** HireVue employs a range of technologies to deliver its services:

* Programming Languages: JavaScript, Python, jQuery, and Java are among the primary languages used in their development stack. [3]

* DevOps and Business Tools: The company utilizes tools such as Twilio SendGrid for email services, Amazon SES for scalable email sending, Optimizely for experimentation and feature flagging, New Relic for performance monitoring, Gmail for communication, WordPress for content management, Font Awesome for icons, G Suite for productivity, Typekit for fonts, Salesforce for customer relationship management, and Marketo for marketing automation.
